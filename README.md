# surfs_up
Tools used: SQLite, Python

# Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
In this project, I analyze the feasibility of a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu, Hawaii. The success of this business would be contingent on warm weather. Thus, the purpose of the analysis is to determine the weather variability in the city during the months of June and December, given 7 years of historical data, to assess if the project would be sustainable year-round. For this exercise, I use SQLAlchemy to link the SQLite database to Python.

# Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

* Temperatures in June oscillate between 64F and 85F, with an average monthly temperature of 74F

* Temperatures in December oscillate between 56F and 83F, with an average monthly temperature of 71F

* Temperature oscillation isn't very brutal as standard deviation is only only around 3F

# Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
